# solving_equations_using_genetic_algorithm
In this project there is genetic algorithm implementation for solving equation.

# Description:
	Genetic algorithm is used to get solutions of equation in less time.
	Equations like: <br />
		* aw + bx + cy + dz = 40 <br />
		* x^2 + y^2 = z^2 (this is diaphontine equation)
	Diaphontine equations are those equations having integer solutions not fraction solutions
	
# Genetic algorthm steps:
	step I:		Initialization chromosomes
	step II:	Evaluation of chromosomes
	step IV:	Selection of chromosomes
	step V:		Crossover of chromosomes
	step	VI:	Mutation of chromosomes
