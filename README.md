# solving_equations_using_genetic_algorithm
	In this project there is genetic algorithm implementation for solving equation. <br />

# Description:
	Genetic algorithm is used to get solutions of equation in less time. <br />
	Equations like: <br />
		* aw + bx + cy + dz = 40 <br />
		* x^2 + y^2 = z^2 (this is diaphontine equation) <br />
	Diaphontine equations are those equations having integer solutions not fraction solutions.<br />
	
# Genetic algorthm steps:
	step I:		Initialization chromosomes <br />
	step II:	Evaluation of chromosomes <br />
	step IV:	Selection of chromosomes <br />
	step V:		Crossover of chromosomes <br />
	step	VI:	Mutation of chromosomes <br />
